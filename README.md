# ELEC4630
My Solutions for the assessment tasks of 2015's ELEC4630 course.

Feel free to use my solutions to help you develop your own. I only ask that you use them as a learning resource rather than as something that you blatantly copy.
I've also not included the marks I got for each assignment, so if you were to copy you might be terribly rewarded.

#### ToDo
I need to clean up the folders, as they have everything that was in them when I though of git'ing this and are thus unsanitary (kinda)
